# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on the complete integration of the existing React frontend and Express backend for the MedScan Pro medical diagnostic dashboard. The system currently has separate frontend and backend components that need to be properly connected, tested, and optimized to work seamlessly together as a unified medical imaging platform with AI-powered fracture detection capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want the frontend and backend to communicate seamlessly, so that I can upload medical images and receive AI-powered diagnostic results without technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads medical images through the frontend THEN the backend SHALL receive and process the files correctly
2. WHEN the backend completes fracture analysis THEN the frontend SHALL display the results in real-time
3. WHEN there are network or server errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to the user
4. WHEN the analysis is in progress THEN the frontend SHALL show appropriate loading states

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want to interact with the AI chatbot for medical consultations, so that I can get detailed explanations about the diagnostic results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message to the chatbot THEN the backend SHALL process it through the OSS medical AI system
2. WHEN the AI generates a response THEN the frontend SHALL display it in the chat interface
3. WHEN the chat session includes analysis context THEN the AI SHALL provide relevant medical insights based on the diagnostic results
4. WHEN the chatbot is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want to download comprehensive diagnostic reports, so that I can save and share the analysis results with colleagues or patients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the download report button THEN the system SHALL generate a complete diagnostic report
2. WHEN the report is generated THEN it SHALL include patient data, analysis results, and AI insights
3. WHEN the download is initiated THEN the file SHALL be saved with a proper filename and format
4. WHEN the report generation fails THEN the user SHALL receive an appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want the application to handle concurrent users and sessions, so that multiple diagnostic cases can be processed simultaneously without interference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN each SHALL have isolated session data
2. WHEN a user starts a new analysis THEN it SHALL not interfere with other active sessions
3. WHEN session data is stored THEN it SHALL be properly managed and cleaned up
4. WHEN the server restarts THEN active sessions SHALL be handled gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want the system to validate all inputs and handle edge cases, so that I can trust the reliability of the diagnostic platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid file types are uploaded THEN the system SHALL reject them with clear error messages
2. WHEN required patient data is missing THEN the system SHALL prompt for completion
3. WHEN the AI model fails to process an image THEN the system SHALL provide fallback responses
4. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry mechanisms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a medical professional, I want the system to be performant and responsive, so that diagnostic workflows are not interrupted by slow processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback on upload progress
2. WHEN analysis is running THEN the system SHALL show real-time progress indicators
3. WHEN large files are processed THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without timeouts
4. WHEN multiple requests are made THEN the system SHALL queue and process them appropriately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper logging and monitoring capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL be logged with timestamps and response codes
3. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL verify all dependencies and configurations
4. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information
